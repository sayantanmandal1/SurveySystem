- **Edge Case Handling**: Uses synthetic data generation to improve robustness

### Innovation and Uniqueness
1. **Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection**: Combines object detection with behavioral analysis
2. **Synthetic Data Augmentation**: GAN-generated scenarios for rare but critical events
3. **Real-time Dashboard**: Interactive monitoring interface with timestamp precision
4. **Configurable Thresholds**: Adaptable to different environments and security requirements
5. **End-to-End Solution**: Complete pipeline from video input to alert dashboard

- **Synthetic Data**: Custom GAN implementation for edge case generation

### System Architecture
```
Video Input → YOLO Detection → Behavior Analysis → Alert Generation → Dashboard
     ↓              ↓               ↓                ↓              ↓
  Raw Frames → Objects/People → Movement Tracking → Anomaly Scoring → Real-time UI
